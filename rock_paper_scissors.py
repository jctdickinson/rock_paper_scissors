Pseudocode drawn up

15 Feb. 2016:
Terrible implementation of pseudocode completed with huge block of if statements

16 Feb. 2016:
Inclusion of dictionary that defines game logic allows for great simplification of program

17 Feb. 2016
Changed varible to store options for computer to a tuple for slight increase in efficiency

To do:
Make code more modular (functions).
Research difference between random.choice(), random.range(), and random.randint()
(used in previous magic8Ball project).
Include input validation (... why are try-excepts acceptable here in Python..?)
