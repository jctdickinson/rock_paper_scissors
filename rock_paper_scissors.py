15 Feb. 2016:
Terrible implementation of pseudocode completed with huge block of if statements

16 Feb. 2016:
Inclusion of dictionary that defines game logic allows for great simplification of program

17 Feb. 2016
Changed variable to store options for computer to a tuple for slight increase in efficiency

18 Feb. 2016
Commented in results of tuples vs. lists

Possible future modifications:
Make code more modular (functions).
Include input validation (... why are try-excepts acceptable here in Python..?)
